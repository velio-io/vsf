(defn ssort
  "Streaming sort.
  Takes a configuration containing a `:duration` and a `:field` key.
  The action will buffer events during `:duration` seconds and then
  send the events downstream one by one, sorted by `:field`.
  ```clojure
  (ssort {:duration 10 :field :time}
    (info))
  ```
  This example will sort events based on the :time field.
  For example, if it get as input:
  ```clojure
  {:time 1} {:time 10} {:time 4} {:time 9} {:time 13} {:time 31}
  ```
  Info will receive these events:
  ```clojure
  {:time 1} {:time 4} {:time 9} {:time 10} {:time 13}
  ```
  You can add a `:delay` key to the action configuration in order to tolerate
  late events:
  ```clojure
  (ssort {:duration 10 :field :time :delay 10}
    (info))
  ```
  In this example, events from previous windows will be sent with a delay of
  10 seconds.
  `ssort` supports sorting on a nested field (example `:field [:nested :field]`)"
